## Automated Lightweight Provenance Capture

[badges removed for double-blind review]

Alpaca is a Python package for the capture of provenance information during the
execution of Python scripts that process data.

Alpaca provides a simple API for recording the details of the functions being
executed, the data flow, and a description of parameters used.
This is accomplished with minimal code instrumentation and user intervention.

Provenance information is structured and serialized according to a model
based on the [W3C PROV format](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview).
