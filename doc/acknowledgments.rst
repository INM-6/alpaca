The development of this open source software was funded by the `Helmholtz
School for Data Science in Life, Earth and Energy (HDS-LEE)
<http://www.hds-lee.de>`_ and  the `Human Brain Project
<http://www.humanbrainproject.eu>`_, funded from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon
2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under Specific Grant
Agreements No. 785907 and No. 945539 (Human Brain Project SGA2 and SGA3).


For the graph summarization/aggregation, code from the original NetworkX
package (version 2.6) was modified. This corresponds to the functions
`ProvenanceGraph.aggregate` (modified from
`networkx.algorithms.summarization.snap_aggregation`) and
`ProvenanceGraph._snap_build_graph` (modified from
`networkx.algorithms.summarization._snap_build_graph`).

The original source code for these functions can be found at
https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/networkx-2.6/networkx/algorithms/summarization.py.
