**************************************************
Alpaca - Automated Light-weight Provenance Capture
**************************************************

A Python package for the capture of provenance information during the execution
of data analysis workflows based on Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

Alpaca provides a simple API for capturing the details of the functions being
executed, together with the description of the data and parameters used.
This is accomplished with minimal code instrumentation and user intervention.

Provenance information is structured and serialized according to a model
based on the `W3C PROV format <https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/>`_.

Examples are provided for the analysis of electrophysiology data, using the
open source packages `Neo <https://neuralensemble.org/neo>`_ and
`Elephant <https://python-elephant.org>`_.

Check the `project page on GitHub <https://github.com/INM-6/alpaca>`_, to
report bugs and issues, or to make contributions to the source code.
